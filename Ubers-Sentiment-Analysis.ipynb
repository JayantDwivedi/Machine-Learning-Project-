with an uber driver in mexico city the car that i got into had no side mirror the brakes were not working properly either i almost got into an accident twice the drivers conversation was unpleasant being a foreigner he was very curious to ask where i am from and what brought me to mexico i replied to be a tourist and through that conversation is over he became very rude and asked me if i came to look for a mexican husband i never answered and kept quiet he took the wrong route and made several in requested stops having in mind it was uberx he continued asked me whom i sleep with he literally stopped the car and asked me to wait for him text someone i asked him to let me go and take a different driver but he locked the doors and didnt allow me ',\n       'i have had my account completely hacked to where i cannot sign in or view it someone spent over 1k in uber rides on my credit and debit cards linked to the account and when i dialed the only number available safety line i was told i would need to wait until another department emailed me i didnt hear anything for almost 24 hours and when i did it was a prompted message that did not help at all it has been almost 2 days and i still have no received a phone call or any helpful support via email this is a nightmare and the worst customer service i have ever experienced i am going to be filing a police report to the person who myself and the driver caught fraudulently using my account and looking into an attorney for uber not making identity theft a priority and rectifying the situation on their end',\n       'i requested an 8 mile ride in boston on a saturday night around 100 am that was coming up around 55 on the app and lyft was around the same rate ended up taking a regular cab that cost me 20 beware of high rates',\n       ...,\n       'great service but hiring drivers who do not know their way around a town and only rely on gps is unrealistic sometimes they just have to know intersections and how to get places without punching it into a gps',\n       'uber has several problems that make it a poor experience for consumers imho based on my own experiences1 their drivers are not welltrained or carefully selected as a result some drivers dont know where they are going and are just bad drivers who would never be hired by a taxi company which in my book is pretty bad so your trip could take twice as long as it should which means if youre late its very hard to depend on uber 2  it costs a lot some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab they also use surge pricing which can increase the price of your fare 3 uber customer service has a bad attitude sort of like youre wrong this is why were right im not saying their customer service is worse than cab companies but i am saying my experience with uber customer service was poor so in summation uber is a good idea poorly executed id try one of the other cab hailing apps in your city flywheel instacab etc because youre likely to save money and have a better driver',\n       'uber is kind of like magic you punch a few buttons on the app on your phone and you watch as a black car appears out of nowhere at your doorstep its so much better than calling a taxi its ridiculous it does come at a price thoughthe black car service ive found to be about 2025 more than a taxi and the uber taxi service was maybe 1015 more but honestly its kind of worth it its so painlessif only every service was like this'],\n      dtype=object)"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Before we explore the
