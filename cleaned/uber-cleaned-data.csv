28/10/2019,1,i have had my account completely hacked to where i cannot sign in or view it someone spent over 1k in uber rides on my credit and debit cards linked to the account and when i dialed the only number available safety line i was told i would need to wait until another department emailed me i didnt hear anything for almost 24 hours and when i did it was a prompted message that did not help at all it has been almost 2 days and i still have no received a phone call or any helpful support via email this is a nightmare and the worst customer service i have ever experienced i am going to be filing a police report to the person who myself and the driver caught fraudulently using my account and looking into an attorney for uber not making identity theft a priority and rectifying the situation on their end,worst

24/03/2019,1,evidently the ridepass that i purchased expired after a month the purported discount was never applied to my account  it automatically renewed making uber the most expensive ride option for me for the consumer uber has erected obstacles to obtaining assistance i will dispute the charges and delete the app,worst
23/03/2019,1,im fuming  i drove for uber and wanted to keep the money earned about 8000 in my account  i knew i would not be able to drive for a while but i thought my money was safe a few months later i tried to get into the site and i could not as it would not except my password i waited another month because it was not that important at this time but what was that bothering me was the fact that i could not get in every time i put my password in it would kick out and not recognize it there is no way i can get a hold of uber there is no customer service  could not call them if you have a problem when they list a problem there is nothing that says anything about trying to receive funds there is no option for me to get this money back according to the way it is set up right now at this point i want to get my money and im going to not drive for  uber but will drive for lyft the area and time of year where i am is extremely populated in desperate need for drivers  uber lost out with my service i am warning you but you better think twice before signing up with them you will never be able to reach them,worst
23/03/2019,1,i had this horrific driver named maria paola im shocked at her 5 star reviews when she arrived she didnt even look at me she probably took one glance at me saw i was an ugly stereotypicallooking asian and was disgusted i got in and she continued to stare straight ahead i smiled and said a friendly hi and she barely said anything back i told her where i wanted to go in a polite and friendly way and she didnt respond i could feel the disdain and disgust from her through the entire ride i respectfully asked her a question about uber since i hadnt ridden it many times before she responded with curtness and condescension i normally enjoy talking with people but she looked so repulsed with me from beginning to end that i didnt dare converse with her it was an incredibly awkward and painful ride when we got near my destination she rudely asked me if that was where it was i patiently directed her to the actual destination nearby her condescension was very clear through her refusal to take a glance at me   and curt answers i could feel the disdain throughout the entire ride  it was hanging in the air when i got off she muttered something like have a good one in the most robotic way like she didnt mean it at all and still stared straight ahead she thought i was so gross she never took a glance in my direction  i would probably blind her pthat was an extremely painful experience  but typical for what i get anywhere in sf the disgust for what people wrongly see as lowly unattractive older immigrant asians is extreme in sf  and anywhere else but in fact im usborn  much more american than she is  and probably younger than her and im surely much cooler than she is p but she couldnt tell and didnt want to know i was surprised to see she had 5 stars on uber  that means shes friendly smiley warm and conversant with other people other riders even wrote that shes friendly and approachable wow she was the complete opposite with me  and rude too with a repulsed vibe that was very obvious throughout the whole interaction the disgust against asians like me is more overt from nonasian immigrants  and she mustve been one from latin america uber  please fire her all uber drivers need to treat all riders with the same level of genuine warmth friendliness and care dont single out some riders for cold rude disgusted treatment for any reason  especially if the riders are friendly polite welldressed and professionalubers response was uncaring and unprofessional i dont think ill ride uber again and please boycott them,worst
23/03/2019,1,i was a frequent uber customer however after today i am so disgusted and disappointed to say the least with uber long story short i typically take an uber with my daughter when i am running late typically the ride is only 850 on average when it is raining the price goes up to about 1250 as expected i took an uber this morning and i had a small spill of my coffee in the rubber carpet floor i immediately told the driver and apologized as i was trying to put a seat belt in my daughter he passed me one napkin and i tried to wipe it as best as possible,worst
22/03/2019,1,im so tired of uber not caring for me as their driver the gps is 90 wrong we losing time and money chasing around customers and dont get paid for it we have a lot of one way street in denver and the gps keeps on telling you to turn where you are not supposed to turn 2 months ago i followed their routes with customers on the car and got a ticket from police for wrong turn and uber told me it was on me washing their hands from their navigation problems how can a multibillions dollars company make their money on navigation and have navigation problem also they get paid the same as us driving if not more than us on rides we have to pay gas and oil change and tires and and and not to mention the tear and wear that brings the value down of our car so stop finding ways to pay us less respect your drivers,worst

21/03/2019,5,we love to use uber all of the drivers we have had are friendly timely and are great drivers i only rated the safety as a 4 as i hear lots of things occurring regarding fake uber drivers there has to be a better way of identifying the driver you are meeting they are getting better and a lot has to do with the passenger as well,best
21/03/2019,5,i took uber for the first time last month my wife and i were at the tokyo airport and had many bags we would have had to wait a few hours for a base bus on standby the vehicle was large and extremely comfortable we got home before the standby bus departed airport the cost was a bit high at 500 but was for a two hour commute,best

20/03/2019,2,my husband and i use uber or lyft frequently when we go out because we dont want to drink and drive even a little we moved a little over a year ago so now our average ride is about 25 minutes since we arent as close to where we go with our friends without a doubt at least the driver going there or coming home makes a complaint about the drive because they would like to stay in the busy area and just do a lot of short drives it makes for a very uncomfortable ride i even had one complain the whole time and then make sure i knew there was now an option for tipping i tip almost all of the time but when i am made to feel uncomfortable because the driver has to do their job and drive me home just farther than they would like why would i tip that driver we all have things about our jobs we dont like but your main job is to drive,worst
20/03/2019,4,uber is convenient and fast cheaper than yellow cab the platform has changed though with the nearby location pickup which is confusing at times because the location might be a couple of blocks from where you requested and the drop off time is near where you want to go even though after drop off the car drives past the location of drop off overall the rideshare company is great,best
20/03/2019,3,from a driver standpoint the rating system is unfair all it takes to ruin your reputation is one passenger having a bad day that they take out on you and dont get me started on the maps they like to send you five miles in the wrong direction,average

19/03/2019,1,i was in san francisco last weekend between my sister and myself uber cancelled on us 8 times where is the credit for them cancelling this was a big problem because they didnt cancel right away so several times the car icon was getting closer and then turning around the drivers we did have were very nice but most of them had no idea about the directions one even got out and ran across the street to ask someone im going to switch to lyft,worst
19/03/2019,1,ive been a uber driver for a year as a contractor i rate uber management system and support team for the drivers uber makes the job so stressful for the drivers by its rating system theres no investigation about the rating has had a logical reason or just a drunk or hallucinated passenger has made a false report of safety issue about a driver i am a middle age lady with 30 years driving experience with no fine or any accident on my driving history my driving account become deactivated by uber because of false safety report uber charges passengers in a high fee rate but pays a little to drivers who has put their life and car in front line of various danger,worst

19/03/2019,5,they are prompt and courteous and if not for the prices i would use them more it would be perfect if the price quoted is the price charged its confusing when it says 7 and they charge more than that when you see the bill,best
19/03/2019,3,the biggest problem i have with uber is the difference in time from what the app shows to actually getting in the car i use uber in many locations some places dont have too many cars around so when the app says 12 minutes but it turns into 22 minutes it messes with my scheduling please be more accurate with your projected time from ordering the ride to the ride showing up at meeting place,average

18/03/2019,1,i needed to update my info in the app and it would not let me i submitted a request to uber and they refused to update my information saying they wanted my drivers license for proof of identity they said in an automated email i have multiple accounts and i do not they claim im a driver which i am not i have only ever been a rider now i have zero access to use the app and they refuse to communicate with me except through auto emails i called the customer service line and the system tells me im not authorized to use the line because im not a premium user this is bs horrible company and even worse customer service,worst

18/03/2019,1,they extort money from people and get away with it for example i bought an uber card for 4000 and it wouldnt work their answer was that i owed 2000 to them when in fact it is impossible to owe uber anything so money was taken from us and we could never get it back i am not the only person that has been stolen from in this way,worst

18/03/2019,4,i have had a few great experiences and a couple of bad experiences worst experience was being picked up in an emergency situation when i needed to get to the hospital to visit someone i was in a hurry and we were already on the highway when i realized the driver reeked of alcohol and was completely intoxicated weaving in and out of lanes and could not keep the car between the lanes the second time with uber that was bad was when the driver made a couple of stops along the way taking me to my destination these stops were in a shady part of town and i was scared to death,best
18/03/2019,5,ive never used lyft before and the only cab company is highly ineffective uber oddly enough has attracted highly qualified a very polite drivers who drive uber to earn extra money i enjoy that scheduling a ride is simple through a smartphone application once uber detects the local drivers via gps it directs the closest driver whos available and provides an estimated time to wait and an estimated time a arrival to your destination uber also allows users to estimate the cost of rides in advance also uber allows the rider to tip directly from the application and also rate the driver ive never had an issue with any uber driver ive used its more uncommon for me now but every so often i do use uber,best
17/03/2019,1,i ordered an uber at the airport for me my boyfriend and his parents so 4 people and a couple luggages the uber pulled over opened his truck and suddenly closed it and said we were too many passengers which we werent and told me to cancel the ride cause he wouldnt take us and just drove off i was really upset and cancelled as per the drivers instruction and was charged a 5 cancellation fee ive been talking back and forth with uber customer service for 4 days now and they refuse to credit me the fee even though they admit im right and apologized for the bad experience their reasoning is that too many fare adjustments were made on my account which were warranted cause i was indeed overcharged on a few trips this completely irrelevant and a completely separate issue and theyre nickel and diming me over 5 this makes absolutely no sense the customer service quality has gone downhill from before,worst
17/03/2019,4,my wife and i are in our 70s and usually only use uber when traveling out of our own area still id say weve used uber about 2 dozen times because we like to travel all our experiences except two have been positive and those two werent all that bad or scary just inconvenient we flit back and forth from uber to lyft depending on where we are some places tend to have more of an uber presence some more of a lyft presence both are good values overall,best
17/03/2019,1,i took uber everyday and although im regular customer they treated me badly and made expensive trips for me although for others are cheap so i dont recommend uber anymore id like to join cream because it is better,worst
17/03/2019,5,i do not drive mostly i walk since i fractured a bone in my foot though i havent been able to walk not even to a train station or bus stop i have been utilizing uber and it has been a godsend  the drivers are polite the cars new and sometimes even fancy other than a few navigational mistakes my experience with uber has been great gets a little pricey though cant wait to have my foot back,best
17/03/2019,4,depending on the location you can get a wide range of customer service when it comes to drivers my experience has basically been a good one places like san diego seem to have a lot nicer more laid back attitude mostly students making money other places like downtown los angeles and most airports have unfriendly drivers where they let you know they are just there to drive no help with luggage no chit chat,best
17/03/2019,5,its a great service its fast and reasonable price i always use this service although i have a car and can drive but uber is easier than finding parking i always recommend it to my friends i thank you for the service uber provided us all the time,best

16/03/2019,3,i rate uber lower since they added per minute charges their appeal came from the flat fee which set them apart from taxis services additionally there is no way to get a specific driver if you like riding with them,average
16/03/2019,4,thrifty for short trips when you have limited time and no car longer distances can be pricey and i generally like cheaper bus or rail if available or sometimes you can rent a car for a day for 15 or less,best
16/03/2019,1,they need to treat patrons better than they do besides there are so many options besides them it is so much easier to go with someone else for the same service i have been changing my provider and better background checks would be nice the people seem so random,worst
16/03/2019,5,uber has provided me and my family with a quick and easy way to get around that doesnt break the bank i have had very few issues with uber the toughest part is usually when travelling internationally trying to get picked up in multilevel airport parking structures,best
16/03/2019,5,ive never had a negative experience with uber it was the one i downloaded first while in college and the one ive continue to use these past 3 or so years some experiences have been better than others but in my opinion the drivers probably have had a worse experience the rides ive enjoyed the most were the ones when myself and the driver have respected each others privacy acted courteously and professional i have witnessed people trash and throw up all over a drivers car and thats not alright i think the thing that has begun to creep into the way i view uber is all of its negative publicity why would i support an enterprise that i dont agree with its not like i am dependent on uber i can use other ridesharing apps i can use a traditional taxi i can even use public transportation despite all of this i still use uber but that might not always be the case,best
15/03/2019,2,saw 3 cars on map and none would come not a big enough fair for them stranded handy caped passenger,worst
15/03/2019,1,horrible experienced i lost my personal belonging at one of theirs uber car and i have emailed helpline with all pictures of the lost item and drivers details but just because trip has not been booked from account no one is going to help i spoke with phone helpline supervisor angela and she told me clearly that she will not get in touch with driver to ask about my lost item just because the trip has not been booked from my account besides that i have all necessary drivers and trip details angela told me too that uber doesnt have complains email how convenient isnt it well i think its time to start use other apps as this days uber is getting too expensive and as you can tell does care about their passengers and their belongings as they are only an agent,worst
15/03/2019,1,this company should be out of business i returned to uber after 1 12 years just to make a little money to pay a bill i drover march 9 and 10 for about a 1 each day i made 6827 i needed the money fast to pay a bill on monday march 11 i tried to cash out and they stop me from cashing out they kept saying something was wrong with my bank information how can that be when ive had the same bank information for over 5 years and the same as when i drove for them a year and a half ago,worst
15/03/2019,5,used uber many times car is always clean  much better than taxicabs which are typically more disgusting than the restroom of a bus station also getting the ride is much more reliable no phone call to a dispatcher and waiting an hour or more you can watch the car on your phone as it approaches,best

15/03/2019,3,some of the rides were great some were awful one car had no ac another car had a seat full of crumbs that i had to sit in another car had all the seats slashed another was not the car i asked for but a very high chevy truck i could not get into i had to go inside the doctors office where i had just left to get a stool so i could climb into the truck the uber driver refused to cancel as he would be penalized and i refused to cancel for the same reason to end the stalemate i was lucky the doctors office had a stool uber is great for when you need a ride and are unable to drive for medical or other reasons however uber does not seem to have any consensus control over the cars people are driving out of all the rides i needed 50 were great and 50 were awful i am thankful i am able to drive again,average
15/03/2019,4,uber does a good job of providing the service but lately their fares have been going up and they now have discontinued the express pool service the idea is to give a more affordable method of transportation right,best
15/03/2019,3,customer service sucks you make a complaint against a driver  nothing happens they work on a star rating but after complaints stars remain the same i only use uber because its cheaper than taxi also communicating with driver is difficult because english is not their native tongue as for the app they use to travel needs some serious looking at it takes the long way home,average
15/03/2019,4,i have always been skeptical about rideshare services because of the news reports of assaults and robberies i used this company for the first time earlier this year during a trip for a conference in las vegas my first ride was excellent and was completed without a problem my second ride was a little scary i requested a ride but then my phone died i was with a friend while i was trying to recharge my phone my friend came to me to tell me that our ride had arrived as we got in the car i had an uneasy feeling i started asking the driver who he was there to pick up and if he knew where we were going he never gave me a straight answer and my friend had already told him where we were going ,best
15/03/2019,5,i have used uber several times and so far i am very happy with the company and how easy its to set up an account i love that they are constantly upgrading features with their company making customer feel safe about taking uber they arrive in a very timely manner and the drivers i have had have all been professional i love that they add a feature that signals the drivers letting them know who you are when you are standing in a crowded area its no fun having your car drive past you and having to wait for them to come back around the block to try and find you,best

13/03/2019,1,i have contacted uber 8 times over 2 months about a driver that still has my phone to this day their answer long story short deal with it not our problem its incredible for a company this huge to provide such horrible customer service theres no number you can call them to in australia literally no way you can talk to one of their customer service staff each and every single time i opened a helped ticket it was closed before the issue was resolved making it impossible for me to contact whoever i talked to before and making me go through all the steps to contact them once again never using uber again,worst

13/03/2019,2,think twice before using this service the drivers are often obnoxious or have an attitude and the cars not large enough to hold luggage if you need to go to the airport or to a cruise terminal what good does a honda civic or ford fiesta do in that instance a briefcase and the trunk is full would be better off using my own car and going to long term parking or taking a train total waste of time and if you say something the driver gets offended and obnoxious,worst

13/03/2019,5,they own their cars they are clean and dont smell they are motivated and speak to us as punters as opposed to taxi drivers who often smell and dont give a jot and often try and cheat by driving the wrong routes to bump up the fare the taxis are also sometimes wrecks in need of repair or replacement,best
13/03/2019,5,no problems gate codes or other info they need when getting the ride as long as i check what the app says my location is versus just pinpointing through app can always send note to driver to correct or clarify location,best

18/01/2019,1,my daughter and i use uber frequently and loved it lately ive noticed that drivers are charging a surcharge and wait charge on every trip ive made without my knowledge the numbers on the mailbox on the road and house are clear and can be read from any direction but yet you continue to park and wait across the street where no one can see you yesterday i went grocery shopping and needed picked up i was charged 75 wait because i had to load my groceries and my child into the vehicle nonsense and a 225 surcharge for who knows what im done being a customer youve lost my business,worst

16/01/2019,2,everytime uber makes an update it inconveniences its riders more and more the update to the gps has caused so much confusion for me and my drivers most of the time the address takes me to the back of the building i ask to go also this new uber pool walking thing in the middle of winter is a horrible idea the whole point of us using uber instead of riding buses is so that we can get dropped off and picked up at our door not walk two blocks in the cold and you shouldnt have to pay extra just to avoid walking ive had drivers cancel either way so we were better off without that update uber used to seem to care more about its customers i wish it would go back to being that way ive been riding ubers since the beginning,worst
15/01/2019,1,i have been a driver with uber for the last twoandahalf years i have been through thick and thin with him and their customers doing bad things to me as a driver i stop driving for them for a while and hope that things would change they have upgraded the app so i tried to start driving again they wanted a new picture of my license ive uploaded it over 10 times sent to them multiple pictures and they keep on saying poor image and then they wont approve it and when i call him they have excuses on all its poor image part of its always the same thing they will never let you talk to a supervisor never let you talk to a manager they never let you talk to anybody in charge theres always people laughing in the background they dont have no respect for their drivers and whoever is going to drive for them they just need to stop because uber wont back you up,worst
15/01/2019,1,as a new sign up i was advised that once i complete 60 rides i will be given an additional 350 dollars as a bonus this was not the case apparently the agent explaining the details missed to clarify that 350 dollars are guaranteed for the first 60 rides in other words if the total for the rides do not add up to 350 dollars they will pay the difference,worst
14/01/2019,1,when uber runs over its customers  buyer betware  ueber is not all that is seems  at first i liked it ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people  but its a crap shoot  id estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them uber has no customer support  theres no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company  case in point  take bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination  bill drives a grand cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime  when bill dropped me off at planet fitness i immediately noticed i left my bag containing an ipod and bose headphones in the back seat about 600 worth of equipment  i tried to wave him down but he wouldnt stop  since then i have sent over 30 texts to him the local ueber office and the corporate hub in stamford  i even asked the stamford police to investigate  as of this moment neither bill nor uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service  the car will get you from point a to poing b but after that your on your own  uber wont lift a finger to help  do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet or keys or handbag or smartphone or lose engagement ring on your finger the smart answer is no bill is still out there lyft is the same as uber  ill check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars,worst
13/01/2019,1,im going on day two of being an uber driver and i hate it uber pays you less to do long distance drives and they dont follow through with their promises before i get into that my biggest complaint is the navigation system its inaccurate and very slow they try to blame your phone service but if it were my service then my maps on my phone or the waze app which is what i use on the daily would glitch out as well,worst

21/10/2018,1,uber needs to understand that their cab pooling service is very time consuming for passengers the drivers go even 12 kms off destination route to pick up and drop other pool riders kindly understand this is very time consuming and we dont reach our destination early not like the fares are superlow that we have to bear this kind of torturous service it would be awesome if uber pool services are far more efficient in the sense each following pick up should not be of 58 mins of difference in terms of distance in this way more people will use pool services and add less to traffic jams uber should not just focus on making money but also contribute to lesser vehicles on roads which is very necessary in cities like bangalore which is overflowing with traffic kindly do make an impact by bettering pool services and reducing cab fares,worst

11/10/2018,1,i have a disability which limits my walking i cant drive due to severe nerve damage and uncontrollable reflexes the closest store to me is a family dollar which is 02 miles from my house the cost for me to uber there is 650750 along with all other companies promising cheaper pricing to make conveniences more affordable is yet another lie after putting taxi cab services out of business rates skyrocketed i cant say how so very disappointed i am with uber i have an upcoming surgery which i pray will be a success i would love to be an advocate for anyone having to utilize transportation services due to no available bus routes so they may travel when needed at a fair price i use to take uber to work the last two years ive paid a private driver to transport me to work which is cheaper than uber 124 miles 5 days a week i havent been able to work in the last 27 days and would appreciate the use of affordable transportation,worst

11/10/2018,1,uber has made transportation much easier however it is overrated and expensive uber only cares about  and drivers but does not care about customers at all first there is not a phone number to reach if you ever encounter any kinds of problems only 10 of drivers are actually nice and professional uber taking your money when the driver cancels the ride is just ridiculous uber should not cut  from your account even if you cancel the ride if our ride cancellations affects the drivers then uber should be able to solve that issue for drivers customers should not be paying even for a single penny if they dont use the ride,worst
09/10/2018,1,on sunday i booked an uber from ghatkopar to vasai at 9 pm the uber drivers name was anand white wagon r he arrived on time when he arrived he asked me where the drop was i told him it was vasai so he said he couldnt travel that far because he stays in panvel and needs to go home i asked him why did he take the booking then he said he didnt know the drop location then i was stern that i will not cancel the booking so he said that someone was unwell at his home so he had to go urgently i know he was lying ,worst
08/10/2018,1,uber drivers made me feel unsafe i had one uber driver harass me and kept calling after the fact i cancelled the ride because he had me waiting over half an hour and then called said he drove to wrong place most drivers are rude and somehow theres always an issue with the app then they dont have customer service or a number where someone can be reached if there is an issue and when i emailed uber about the driver making me feel unsafe since he kept calling me and harassing me their only response was to block the driver or call law enforcement they need to fix the app and thoroughly background check these people they hire,worst
08/10/2018,1,worst thing with uber is that they do not have any real time support if anything goes wrong you have to fight with the driver and then take out time later on to sit and write a complaint and in reply all you will get are saved templates i had to book and cancel six cabs back to back because driver denied destination and also denied cancelling the trip and then the funniest thing is after all this uber blocked from booking any more cab its like you go to a shop where the sales guy refuses to sell and then the owner comes and ask you to leave because you did not buy anything is this businesses or madness,worst
05/10/2018,1,i had a problem with a driver cancelling and being stranded on the street corner with no ride i asked support if there was any way to schedule rides so i didnt experience cancellations among other concerns i got a form letter response saying that the 500 i was charged for not getting a ride had been refunded i already knew that the email for uber customer service does not allow for twoway communication i guess uber can provide nothing and call it customer service anyway,worst

02/10/2018,1,today i left my cell phone in the uber every avenue i have taken to try to contact uber has led to a dead end i need the verification code sent to my phone in order to login from my desktop but i do not have my phone so i cannot get the verification code there is a page purportedly just for resolving this issue but it no longer works i emailed customer service for help getting into my account and at 12 hours later i have not had a response i emailed them all day actually i called the only number available that number is for drivers there are no telephone numbers for riders unless you have the app on your phone but i dont have my phone the lady on the driver line promised to help me then she put me on hold for 40 minutes so i finally hung up while i was on the driver line i heard all the things uber is doing for their drivers as a driver centric company they do not care about the consumer at all this is wrong just plain wrong,worst
02/10/2018,1,i took an uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car i contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app he confirmed he had the cardigan he said when he is back in my area he would drop it off i did not hear back for a while so contacted him again he said he would drop it off to me but id have to pay almost 45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the uber offices in canary wharf i then asked he drops it off at canary wharf i also asked that he let me know the details i will need to collect the item my fare to the hospital was 7 by the way anyway the driver whose uber user name is abobacar stopped responding to me i contacted uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail so i suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so theres nothing they can do i filed a police report and the police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf i relayed the message to uber but they declined a few weeks after abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing so i asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item they did not respond to that the moral of the story is if you have a problem with an uber driver uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it they appear to have a finders keepers policy it is disgraceful i still use uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as i get a chance to find one also i will send an invoice to uber as advised by the police i will follow up with feedback at a later date beware of abobacar the uber driver,worst

29/09/2018,1,i have never had an issue with uber in the last two years of using their service until two days ago when i scheduled a ride the night before upon entering the details a window popped up on the app indicating a pick up guarantee if the driver did not show up within the window of time allotted the passenger would be credited 10 for a future ride so long as it met the eligibility criteria my driver exceeded the window of time and arrived later as a result i was late to arrive for my appointment i wrote to customer service and requested the credit the rep stated they would credit 5 instead when i quoted their policy verbatim the second rep stated they would not be paying any additional credit 24 hours later they still havent even credited the 5 its annoying that as a loyal user with a pretty good rating cant even get something like this resolved and in line with ubers policy,worst

09/09/2018,1,car number plate gfi4czkthis may not reflect the whole of uber however as my first and subsequentially last uber ride i think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again first he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage literally 4 shopping bags despite it fitting with an excess of room then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company would recommend uber to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we as customers do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day it may be amazing in the us but in the uk you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service if you use uber and get this number plate then save yourself the bother and find another car,worst

07/08/2018,1,beware this company allows drivers to submit fake pictures claiming you made a mess of their cars and will charge you up to 150 extra without even giving you the common decency of a phone call i was hit with a totally false charge and uber initially refused to refund me i did absolutely nothing to the driver or his vehicle yet when this claim hit my email because uber does absolutely nothing over the phone they had already charged me without hearing my side for any details please avoid this alleged criminally designed company they are not worth the headache and definitely not worth your hard earned money,worst

03/08/2018,1,i have never experienced a worse service experience than i have had with uber both here in the us and on my recent trip to the uk i dont understand how a company can be allowed to do business when it treats their customers the way i was treated i got a promotional code from citibank aadvantage credit card services to use a promo code so i can get credit on my first 2 rides with uber i had never used uber before so i downloaded the app and proceeded to put in the promo code i kept on getting error messages so i tried to get a customer service phone number in the us to my surprise a company as big as uber does not offer any phone customer service in the us a multibillion dollar company with no phone customer service,worst

24/07/2018,1,uber has really been difficult i would like to use my account to order food but the number associated with my account is almost 5 years old i havent had that number in at least 3 years but they will not allow me to change it because according to support the only way to change it is through the app so i download the app and enter my number but obviously that doesnt work cause its not associated with my email it is however associated with the driver account i attempted to make but there was no email associated with that account because the process was not finished,worst

24/07/2018,5,i have used several ride share companies and believe its the best idea for travel whether short or long distances the drivers were always on time for pickup and dropoff to all destinations were always polite informative and cordial but most importantly i always felt safe because they were registered with a business who does background checks would provide photos of the car and driver accepted all forms of payment conveniently provide their app on smart phones and rating scale for satisfaction,best
24/07/2018,5,i used uber when i had no ride to my post op visit and couldnt drive yet it was a lifesaver i got to my appointment in time and caught another driver back it seemed a lot to spend 50 round trip but also a necessity when i couldnt drive,best

23/07/2018,5,ive been using uber for years to take trips home from the store its a really convenient app for me especially because i dont have a car the drivers are almost always nice i think its been so rare for me to have a bad experience with someone also probably the one feature i have not been a fan of us is seeing my customer rating gives me a bit of anxiety overall its a good service ive almost never had to wait more than 10 minutes too the prices have gone up but i am thinking and hoping this is because they will pay drivers better,best
23/07/2018,3,the drivers were fine the problem was i could not speak to a live person it was very frustrating not to be able to talk to a person on occasion it took me over 2 hrs to book a ride their system went haywire,average
23/07/2018,4,it is a good service but the website or app has very little on questions from users it is very difficult to see if the service is good or not through the website you need to try it first and the service keeps on changing without notice which in some ways is great but no upfront info or call in to talk to,best

28/06/2018,1,i have been taking lyft for couple of days now and their application is totally accurate with the fare i took uber today the same service uberx and their application says 18 same amount as lyft and took it because i know i have a 5 discount from my recommendation and i am regretting it now but when i received the receipt it says that my fare is 23 and deducted my 500 discount and a total of 18 this is probably the reason why they dont have customer service contact number,worst

19/06/2018,1,uber needs to be shut down they treat the drivers unfairly also the riders im always being short paid instead they increase the service fee how is it that they get paid more than me on a trip that doesnt make sense drivers need to come together and report them or even boycott for a while until they fix the issues we are having and stop cheating us if nothing changes then they uber need to be ban from atlanta,worst

17/06/2018,1,so generally i prefer lyft over uber mainly because over time it became apparent to me that lyft has a better attitude towards its customers than uber and my suspicion was confirmed a few months ago when the story broke about sexual harassment claims at uber and how they were handled until now though i had never really experienced firsthand the callous nature of ubers leadership here is my story,worst

21/05/2018,1,got an uber for a 5 mile one way trip everything seemed fine paid fare and gave 15 tip which i thought was generous given the extremely short ride received message the next day that driver reported that i left an item in her car and she returned it to me resulting in an additional 15 fee paid directly to driver i left nothing in vehicle and she dropped nothing off to me googled and apparently these fraudulent fees for lost item returns and cleanings that never happened are common amongst uber drivers to increase their income beware,worst

07/04/2018,1,uber as a company does not care about consumers first there is no way to communicate or get support second there is no consistency between the website and the app what can be done in one cannot in the other and vice versa third the app does not always do what it is told for instance i wanted to pay with a credit card and it defaulted to another account even though i specifically chose the cc fourth the app rates the rider but does not give feedback how does a rider know what they did that offended the driver so they can correct it finally the web page and the app are cumbersome it is extremely ironic that a user has to verify they are not a robot to access a utility run completely by computers,worst

09/12/2017,2,like the drivers and ease of hailing  a ride  also app is pretty good as long as everything is going well  however in nov and dec of 2017 my account was hacked and fraudulent rides were clocked in in london and paris while i was in the usa  first time it was 4 rides last time it was 9 rides and it all added up quickly  two of my cc were used in the process necessitating my cc company to shut down one of my main credit cards what a hassle to deal with all that  customer service once you got it was great as they did reverse charges so the only folks out of the money i would assume would be the drivers unless uber picked up the fraud tab  but uber did charge me a fee for reversing charges so i did not walk away completely unbruised  i promptly shut down my account and will find another rideshare service that is more secureuber has got some issues to work out their culture as recent news reports allude to but also a better way faster and easier to alert corporate about big problems with the app and web site and fraud etc  the system as it is now is elusive and painstakingly complex4 stars for the service  riders  1 star for the hacking  2 stars total as my reviewrankingjp,worst
08/12/2017,1,i happened to book an uber ride driver accepted the ride even after 15 mins i dint see car moving around i tried calling the driver he didnt respond i messaged on uber app mentioning the address and asking him if he is going to pick me up driver cancelled after 5 mins or so i was stranded with no where to go this is ridiculous again uber charged me cancellation charges when driver cancelled the ride this driver has 5 rating when i reached uber customer service asking me to compensate as i have wasted 30 mins bcos of driver uber says  its ur problem and drivers we cant take any responsibility for driver actions _x000d_why customers are charged cancellation charges when we cancel even after 2 mins here driver cancelled after 15 mins _x000d_uber is a ridiculous company which is misusing customer data and leveraging the loop holes_x000d_uber should be banned in us and every customer whose personal info is leaked should be paid compensation  uber tracks every movement and claims its to improve trip experience_x000d_my suggestion is first do a proper driver orientation and back verification which will definitely improve customer experience _x000d_notice that if anyone has lyft and uber uber price is lower but if ur using uber alone they hike the price they do a predatory pricing,worst

18/10/2017,1,uber support just sends âcannedâ responses for questions there is no escalation path they dont seem to read the issue and they have multiple agents responding to the same ticket so you repeat the issue endlessly because they have nobody taking accountability for the ticket from beginning to end they just close tickets and mark resolved so the agent can increase their ticket count worst support department ever  they should implement a rate the support agent so they will get metrics on how bad their support is,worst

16/10/2017,1,uber drivers in sydney and other cities around the world  have a bad habit of accepting jobs from miles away and sometimes up to 20mins while still dropping off a passenger and while there are dozens of cars very close to the new job location i had one this morning again to take me from home in rushcutters bay to work in the city and there were at least 6 cars within 12mins from my location this the  uber driver still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away uber needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry if customers want  service they would take a cab the solution could be very simple offer a function on the app for the users to manage a circular area around the pickup zone beyond which uber drivers are excluded from picking up rides simple,worst
13/10/2017,2,my experience with uber was in san francisco in april 2017 uber is still hiding in the shadow and will not come up front and center to pick you up they lurk around the corner and if the wait too long for you they cancel the ride this is a damaged game of hide and seek,worst

26/09/2017,5,uber drivers that ive dealt with have always been professional safe drivers and a pleasure to deal with their cars have always been clean mostly newer models and wellmaintained for the most part the drivers get you in a short period time however occasionally you might get a driver that suddenly realizes he doesnt want to take the call and you suddenly see on the map that hes going in a different direction that could be frustrating when youre waiting for pick up luckily it has rarely happened overall uber is very good,best

25/09/2017,4,using uber was a pleasant surprise and i love the fact that they are available on short notice the prices are much more affordable than the taxi cabs i was using prior to uber and fare payment via credit card is great they offer and deliver good service which i felt was safe and everything already in the system and no need to pull out anything i also tried uber as driver for several months it was fun i only had one incident that caused me concern after calling uber and confirming a ride between 11001130 pm close to a price surge time i was switched to several different driver confirmations which caused a 45minute wait and that night i finally called a cab,best
25/09/2017,4,i live in a very small town and at times there is no one available to pick up uber is great in large metropolitan areas drivers are very polite and punctual i noticed that the ride would state a different amount however after i am dropped off the price has increased there is no customer service number i understand that even the drivers dont have a main number to contact for uber corporate that is a serious issue every company should have a human to speak with for concerns,best
25/09/2017,1,i will and always have admitted its not about loyalty but business i supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies and in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry however there are and will continue to be more rideshare business look what napster did to the music industry and look where napster is now uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand i am on time for my driver respectful treating them the way i want to be treated and despite not liking the tipping i still do it i dont like the rating as its pointless if i give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly anything less than a 55 for a driver is wrong so the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score then there is this tipping which i have been in the service industry and support it but uber was all about the no tipping and now if you dont tip enough or worse on time the driver rates you poorly personally i dont care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride this is where the problem issome examples i dealt with is i had a driver in montreal who didnt speak english and i did the best i could to communicate in french and so my rating goes down in phoenix my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when i couldnt use his same thing and most recently in seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesnt know seattle well i had to end up using my own gps using international data and yet now i get a bad review i was scared to give this lady a 45 yet alone worse and i have gained other examplei have supported uber coming to calgary and edmonton even when they were booted out temporarily now that i live near vancouver i was supporting them coming there as well now im starting to change my mindmy point is now im considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab regardless ride sharing will continue to grow the question is will uber be a part of this or eventually not exist like napster being just another company that started a trendfyi they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident,worst
24/09/2017,3,i have used uber 3 times once the driver got lost causing me to miss my bus and costing me 60 extra fare the other times were ok but i believe way overpriced sorry not a fan,average
24/09/2017,5,i used uber for a couple of medical appointments the drivers were prompt and so friendly and i could not have been happier the cars were spotless and i had lots of floor space the rides were smooth because the cars were very nice and thats important with all my back issues i highly recommend uber to anyone and everyone,best
24/09/2017,4,the service was convenient just a phone call and they came to our location the drivers were always on time courteous and helpful their fee was usually less than the commercial cab fares and the vehicles were all clean and efficient,best
23/09/2017,4,its a really great thing they should have more incentives for discount rides after you build up lots of rides or give them references for business but other than that they are very safe and a great concept,best

23/09/2017,1,my son booked me an uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport when i got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes when i told him i had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride i rang my son who said it definitely wasnt shared and to tell the driver to get a move on he refused to i asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no i asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call i explained that if i missed the one train an hour id miss my flight and there wasnt another one for seven days effectively id lose my whole holiday he shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour there was nothing i could do and even if id got out of his car hed taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab this was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers  but i made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage i will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again,worst

15/09/2017,4,i hear about uber from friends that used it they all say the same thing about this company and that is the ease of getting the service 24 hours a day and the price which is better than a taxi,best
15/09/2017,4,i enjoy the cheap cost but i feel saddened by the negative impact on the taxi drivers that have far better qualifications to drive people around so many uber drivers do not know the area in which they drive and are not safe drivers often not obeying basic driving rules,best

11/09/2017,3,uber began as a very reputable alternative to other livery services however that has changed rates are quoted as one amount and billed higher the drivers are miserable some of them actually hit their female customers ubers customer service is literally nonexistent and with the exception of booking a car all of their online services are at best horrible,average

30/08/2017,1,i was picked up from my workplace on 3082017 at around 856 pm by cab no tn 07 ce 8554 the trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour when i refused to get off away from my pick up point while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off i have never seen such behavior in my life the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip you are taking responsibility for our time safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us you cannot waste our time compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say ok we wont charge you this time looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards,worst

02/07/2017,1,i had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation however my friend and i called for an uberwhich i highly regret nowthat totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible_x000d_my friend had took my phone to call for an uber the uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination after waiting around for a bit we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry he was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated once i told him we were in arrivals he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride and uber had to audacity to charge me for no service _x000d_in the normal world when people arrive at a destination from a flight they get picked up in arrivals i tried to contact uber but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip all i wanted was my money back and i probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use uber if they had simply refunded mehowever they would only give me uber credit to use on my next trip and still charged my card i told them to remove the charge from my card but they said that was against their policy _x000d_i have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellationbut i dont know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refundwhich wouldnt qualify as a policy _x000d_i guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple 5 cancellation that simple 5 costs them close to 200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using lyft and other transportation services instead my first lyft ride was really great the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs_x000d_back to the point uber is not a good companythere are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers they prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead im not just referring to the drivers some have which have been nice to me on other occasions im referring to the corporate dogs that devalue everyone around them here is a link to an article if you would like to learn more about the toxicity of the uber culture _x000d_httpswwwmediabistrocomemployerblognewstraviskalanickkinghrfailsfinallyousteduber,worst

09/06/2017,1,uber mentions standard upfront charges for their pool rides but if the person you are pooling with cancels the ride uber will introduce dynamic charges and charge that extra amount to you and i guess they even charge the person who cancels so in a way uber is making 2 way money they charged me 3 times the normal charge for a ride where another pooler cancelled the ride and now they are fooling me saying that since the distance travelled was more than what was entered originally they are charging me more but actually distance increased because the driver had to pick up another pooler now this person didnt turn up so entire money load comes on me,worst

06/06/2017,2,recently use uber to and from ny la guardia airport from my home in riverdale ny  the fare was 1700 higher on the return trip than going to the airport  when i complained to uber i was told that surge pricing applied to my return trip  surge pricing is in effect during periods of high demand high or heavy trafficor bad weather  none of these conditions applied  in fact we asked the driver upon pick up if it was particularly busy and he confirmed clearly it was not  in fact he said it was extremely light  there was absolutely no traffic on the trip from the airport to my home   conversely on the trip to the airport three days earlier when my fare was 1700 lower the driver said traffic was extremely heavy and she took an alternate route to save time  _x000d_i firmly belive uber also uses their surge pricing as a means to increase revenue during normally quiet times forcing customers to pay higher fares in order to make up for fewer rides requested  i find this very disturbing and unethical  finally in ubers response to my complaint i was told that the fare was displayed before i accepted the ride  and while this is true i needed a ride home and price gouging is improper and unethical in any situation  i am looking into other ride apps and will avoid uber in the future,worst

21/05/2017,1,i am wondering if all the uber drivers are given the ability to actually fire clients making it so that they and their families can no longer use the uber service and on top of that rob that person of 50 there were 2 cancellations on this evening both by the same driver in the same hour on this night my 18 year old son who had struggled from kidney failure since birth and whose growth was somewhat stunted was hanging out with friend at the sci fi factory near keller tx was ready to walk the 15 miles home when i told him just to wait and id get him an uber the uber driver pulled up took one look at my son and screamed you have to be 18 to ride then he pulled away leaving my son standing there never asked for id never even gave me a call ,worst
20/05/2017,1,i spent over an hour of my personal time seeking the lowest fare to the airport following meetings in grand rapids mi im a government employee and every dollar counts out of over 30 options reviewed uber was by far the cheapest at 16 from downtown next best was 20 and then the others hovered around 3545 google revealed the secret technique on how to preorder a 515am uber the night before_x000d_out of the shower i spy a circa 515am text that due to surge pricing my 525am fare would now be 35x what we had agreed to the previous evening and i had 5 minutes already spent in the shower i could cancel without being charged a fee the soonest cab 40 fare was 20 minutes away that i couldnt spare at this point my 16 deal now cost 51 cancelling uber at this point would mean a missed flight lost connections and expensive misery there was nothing to do but pay whatever they asked sort of like breaking down in the middle of nowhere with the only mechanic being the crooked sheriffs brother well played uber well played i cant help but think this is a frequently used wellplanned scenario or else they would have made me aware of this surge thing the night before being a possibility  had they done so i would have used a stable priced cab service i shall never use uber again they not only screwed me but all the transportation providers that were cheaper than 50 i also am left with a bitter taste of my grand rapids experience although everything else during my visit was superb i will never recommend uber to a friend or worst enemy none of this had anything to do with my driver she was great,worst
20/05/2017,2,this is a reasonable service  however they intentionally do not have a way to reach the service or the driver  as a result if youve forgotten something youre out of luck  for example my dealer uses uber  the driver was quick and efficient  as i got out of the car and thanked him he drove way  no problems  but just then i patted myself down and realized by bluetooth  with charger had fallen from by pocket  i could see him driving down the hill but he did not see me  i quickly asked the service manager to call the uber driver thinking i could catch him before he turned onto the main road  nope  we dont know how after 45 minutes of keystone copism i have an email to a brittany  no phone number and then after much research if find out there is no phone number intentionally  so while i tried the contact us mode that didnt work  and it turns out uber is satisfied with not hearing from its customer in the event they really need to be reached  caveat emptor,worst
20/05/2017,5,i noticed that the reviews for uber were low on this site so i felt compelled to share my positive experiences with readers my husband has been using uber for quite some time because he does a lot of traveling with his occupation we used uber together on our trip to san juan puerto rico recently and every ride was 5 star and top notch the drivers were friendly and professional all of the vehicles we rode in smelled fresh and clean we actually had a taxi driver harass one of our drivers and although we had our uber driver pick us up at the business next door to our hotel the taxi driver could tell it was uber because my husband had his phone in his hand  we waved to the uber driver i can honestly say that due to the taxi driver scaring me by bullying our driver i will never take a taxi again as long as i live last i checked we live in a capitalist society and competition is good for us taxis should not have a monopoly i highly recommend uber,best
19/05/2017,1,uber gives men a chance to cheat on there girlfriends or wifes ive had it happen to me and know other women its happened to the guy would say im doing uber but really hes going to meet another women so be care other women out that you boyfriend or husband is really doing uber and not out cheating on you i think uber is ruining lives and destroying relationships i think uber should be a schedule hours and should be online so many hours before getting paid or something to ensure men wont cheat,worst

11/05/2017,1,after reading reviews by other disgruntled customers i can see that my experience is unfortunately normal _x000d_i arrived at manchester uk airport around 1030 pm and used the app to contact a driver the app showed the driver was 35 minutes away but i waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasnt easy to be met however i didnt receive a call and when i tried calling i didnt get an answer _x000d_i didnt give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didnt help on one of the ride requests i cancelled within 5 minutes now back at home i see that uber charged me 5 us for each cancelled ride even the one i legitimately cancelled_x000d_im glad theres a forum like this to lodge a complaint but would prefer the message reached a wider audience since i now have read that uber was given an f by the better business bureau the public should know they are scam artists ,worst

14/04/2017,3,concept of uber is great try finding customer service is the pits once you contact them via messaging you will find that if you have an ongoing conversation replies their system is set up to tag next available service rep meaning every time you send in your reply a new service rep has to review all the conversations to get the rest of the customers problem extremely time consuming on both parts my wife is presently texting them as i write im not a patient man and have spent two three days going back and forth on a relatively simple question how do i add my payment method to my account simple right what a bs management team they have it usually lies on management too,average

02/03/2017,1,uber is thirsty for money even when they know they cannot pick you up within the time stated they make you wait and charge you a cancellation fee if you dare to choose another option this company is on a downward spiral up with lyft down with uber how dare you disappoint a customer during mardi gras season,worst
02/03/2017,1,i live in las vegas nv and had an experience with one of their drivers tailgating me on the freeway w passenger in their car i have sent them messages through their website and every other form of social media to just let them know they need to check their drivers more thoroughly and they are nitwits i am getting canned responses and no one is acknowledging the issue at hand sounds like a real winning company thats for sure,worst
02/03/2017,1,i have been using uber for quite some time now normally through the app but since im fighting with my phone company i have been ordering via internet at mubercom i normally take the pool because it is cheaper obviously but mubercom doesnt provide fair quotes for the pool i have to cross reference with uberx first to ensure no surging then make pool request so i did that like normal and the price was 1116 so i figured the pool should be at least less than 11 to my surprise i paid 1552 i even took a screenshot and sent it over to uber but no reply except the automated message straight rip off use lyft,worst

19/01/2017,1,uber for me is so buggy that i can simply not use it i can not get my head around how a billion dollar company can not build a working app or website _x000d_bug design flaw 1 you need to request permission through support to use the mobile website as a rider_x000d_bug 2 right now the entire helpubercom website is down for hours what_x000d_bug 3 once youve been granted permission to use the mobile webinterface for rides there is no way to change your phone number theres an edit button for the phone number on the nonmobile website but this then tells you to go to the app which you cant use thats why youre using the mobile site durrrr_x000d_bug 4 design flaw once youve signed up with uber there is no easy online way to delete your uber account ive looked into this and you actually need to contact support the same support whos webpage is completely down right now and write them an email saying you want your account deleted really in 2017 theyre a billion dollar company but their website and software is worse than that written by a startup full of 12 year olds in their moms basement i feel sorry for any talented coders working under ubers obviously out of control management,worst

12/01/2017,1,i have been driving with uber for over three months i have great reviews from passengers who i have dropped off at many locations all around orlando i strongly recommend that no one drives with uber they are complete rip off you will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you dont even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if theres a rude passenger which uber does not confirm who the passenger is they will cause damage to your car and once he reported to uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and i did no longer responsible any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay 1000 or more to fix your own car they dont want to take responsibility for anything and when you sign up for uber it clearly states that they are responsible for damages caused by passengers,worst

08/01/2017,1,this review is not just about the airport pick up but in general for people who wish to know how to travel_x000d_the best and only taxi company that i would recommend is blue bird they are great they always use the meter and the drivers are professional_x000d_the other taxi companies dark blue purple grey colour taxis not the light blue  blue bird taxis are all rip offs  be careful they are scammers and rude 99 of the time_x000d_ok now onto uber it can be great and it can be not so great i would say 75 of the time it is good but if you get one of these drivers look out _x000d_booked a uber ride at 609pm with driver i dewa made satrya to pick up from nikki beach club after waiting at the front of the club for 10 mins it was clear he was not coming as his vehicle which was 1km away was not moving in our direction but i was surprised when the app changed to being on the journey a few minutes later it finished but i was charge 15000 rah of course you waste time and write to uber the they refund it but why should loyal passengers need to go through such crap when it is clearly not their fault_x000d_i then booked uber again at 619pm the same driver i dewa made satrya accepted the booking but this time he messages me on whatsapp to tell me unless i pay cash he is not coming so i try to change the payment method to cash but this is not allowed on the uber app so when i tell the driver this he says unless i pay him cash he will not come  he then asked me to cancel but luckily it is within the 5 min bs time limit so i am not charged a cancellation fee this time even though again it is not my fault_x000d_i advised the driver i dewa made satrya that the service is terrible he told me he does not care and when i said i would report this service to uber he said i do not fear clearly uber does not care for passenger service and is happy to hire anyone in bali as a driver as i would never employee someone with such an attitude especially when now 18 hours later he just sent me another offence message to my phone you emang top_x000d_anyway avoid the driver i dewa made satryawith phone number 62 821 4407 1347_x000d_i then attempted to make another booking this time it was picked up by driver nyoman this booking was at now 629pm this driver was 8 minutes away and started driving to my location so i was thinking great finally have a driver he was within about 3 minutes away and then i noticed he kept going passed the turn off and when i contacted him he said he is not coming i could see on the app he was like 3 mins away then 6 mins 9 min 12 min and clearly not coming to nusa dua but driving to ulawatu this driver just ignored all contact from me via messagephone just keep driving and i guess waiting for me to cancel which i finally did clearly another driver that does not care for passenger service_x000d_please avoid nyoman driver and his number is 62 812 3786 5029 he clearly does not care and should not be allowed to drive for uber_x000d_ok so finally made another booking with uber it is now 640pm the guy turns up very nice driver but as i got into the car and sat down my daughter was just getting into the car and the driver starts to drive off without her being in the car the door was still open my daughter then hit the road and was left on the street this was clearly an accident but careless driving from uber i will not write his name as he was nice but clearly not careful_x000d_anyway basically after about 4 bookings waiting 40 minutes writing to uber for refund for my 15000 rph we made it home to the villa in seminyak_x000d_honestly i love uber use it all over the world however i think in some cities like china especially beijing bali and sydney the server now is terrible and the prices are on the increase so a taxi can be about the same  once uber gets the marketshare they want they increase the prices without warning,worst
08/01/2017,1,why is it if they take money out of your account for the uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say its an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that i cannot access and another thing if you have an uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold  when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the uber gift card i have for three weeks been trying to resolve this problem on two separate situations and the customer service is horrible isnt it illegal for them to keep a hold on your  money even after they get paid for the services of an uber driver taking you to your destination and why does it take so long for it to drop off from your checking account they should confirm you have the money then debit your account for the uber ride and then thats it i am trying to find out  how to issue an official complaint against uber because of the situation can you please help,worst

02/01/2017,1,my first experience with uber was absolutely horrible a driver by the name of wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe comfortable and convenient way to get to our location it was not the car ford focus was in horrible shape the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains the vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad i could hardly breath and the driver was very unprofessional he didnt use gps and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way we accepted since there was room but then wylder drove around for 30 min looking for this other potential client he finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said i am suppose to be looking for a girl named brittany umm that would be me he didnt seem to know what he was doing one bit i felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions with this being my first experience with uber i was very dissatisfied and probably wont be using the services again,worst

02/07/2016,1,uber lies about their incentives for example they say 50 an hour for lake tahoe driving the terms are you have to complete one ride per hour at least however they will not give you one ride per hour the only thing they want is more driver in that city you will not get the 50 because they dont give you one ride per hour they just want more driver so it will be available when customers request,worst
01/07/2016,1,i took an uber from downtown manhattan to port authority 42nd  8th ave and it costs 50 are you kidding me right now first of all the driver obviously didnt know what avenue to take even after i told him 1 hour to get to midtown pure bs and why was it sooo expensive because the base fare is 700 and then 1316 for 351 miles and then 3151 for the 49 minutes that i wasted in the damn car grand total 5167 never again and i would advise everyone to stay away from uber if you dont want to get ripped off,worst

29/06/2016,1,up until 2 days ago i had been an uber partner for over a year and must say their practices are very questionable 1st point drivers how can a company claim they do background checks and on countless occasions have the drivers be a bunch of menacing idiots providing questionable rides in even more questionably safe cars all the while being more focused on hisher phone conversation than the road seriously now if these checks were in fact being done then why the battle for not allowing drivers to be fingerprinted its an honest question and quite frankly a legit one you claim your drivers are safe but are unwilling to back that up with something so simple as fingerprinting let the buyer beware ,worst
28/06/2016,1,i have been an uber driver for a few months now uber drivers beware if you have a rider who is going to get sick in your car get them out of your vehicle as quickly as possible uber does not protect you against damages to your vehicle and getting them to get reimbursement for damage to your vehicle is like pulling teeth one of my riders got sick in my vehicle first i tried to download the pictures to their app under my rider damaged my vehicle the app doesnt allow me to download i had to go down to the uber center location because uber doesnt have any over the phone representatives to support you when damage occurs ,worst
25/06/2016,1,the surge pricing is a huge scam i was charged 93 for a 45 ride in a car that was falling apart i could have had a limo for 85,worst

16/06/2016,1,i am an uber driver  uber is a fundamentally dishonest company  first of all in over two years of driving ive never met or spoken to anyone who works for the company  its all done via email  second anytime you write them for any reason you receive a canned response that shows your original email was neither read nor comprehended by a human then they wont adjust fares when youve been shorted until youve sent at least five or six emails   finally theyll relent usually  youll get multiple responses that are canned and look like dialogue from valley of the dolls  _x000d_the people who get in your car are sometimes smelly and your car will smell the next day  also uber is a terrible corporate citizen 85 cents a mile75 cents for uber pool plus 13 per minute means that when you deduct 575 cents a mile while riders are in the car and 575 cents per mile to get to the rider youll lose money on each and ever ride  this means a full time uber driver will never pay a dime in taxes qualify for social security or have any money in life  all full time uber drivers will end up a burden to the government while their cars have been polluting the environment  _x000d_the wussy county commissions all across the country that have rolled over for this company are anything but public servants  they are fools  if you want a cheap ride do not care about taking advantage of other humans and like rewarding a greedy morally bankrupt corporation by all means continue too use uber  _x000d_also uber pool  you get into a car with people you dont know and a driver you dont know  you go on a route you dont need to go on  as a driver youre a rolling day care center for drunks  uber company calls us drivers partners  thats crap  they treat us as if were illiterate mentally challenged minors   they lie threaten and constantly sell lie after lie after lie  my prediction is uber will continue to have success for a long time ahead but will come to be vilified as the horrific example of greed that they are  _x000d_their treatment of people and disregard for our environment our laws and most of all the safety and well being of their drivers is as egregious as any company in the history of america  the pussy politicians that are rolling over for this company are also an embarrassment to our country,worst

24/05/2016,1,a few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home it was very late and when i had gotten in the cab the driver seemed really aloof and tired i was very courteous asked him how his night was and the response i got was very groggy and rude regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone i started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned i asked politely if he could slow down and again he answered with a rude tone of voice_x000d_a few days go by and i get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged 16500  the driver had accused me of vomiting in his car and took fake photos and sent them to uber it was appalling and the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting it looked liked mushy popcorn and water and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car was just so gross _x000d_never in my life have i thrown up in someones taxi cab and if i had felt sick i would have politely told the man to pull over i was not sick i was not drunk and i remember the ride clearly nothing along those lines had happened and i am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible not only did he accuse an innocent passanger but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account terrible,worst
22/05/2016,1,i have been driving for uber for over nine months it was bad enough when they lowered the rates for our work i got past that and kept on driving well last week in my review they gave me a low score saying a rider said my vehicle didnt meet their standard of cleanliness this was not true because i am constantly cleaning my vehicle and passengers are always ccomplementing me on how fresh my vehicles smells after passengers are in and out of your vehicle you will realistically have some sand in the floor there is no way to logically and safely vacuum your car out between the hours of 10pm and 4am thats makes no sense which is what they tried to suggest to clean the car after each fare  how if u get trips back to back when do you clean of course if someone vomits youre going to clean that mess up but to top it off when they said the car wasnt clean they took the opportunity to throw in there saying remember your personal hygiene as well which was not even the comment i was personally offended and have not driven sense i am a clean person and just because my car was not emuculate enough for one rider shouldnt have turned into the opportunity to insult me i know it was an automated response but those two responses need to be separated from each other because they are two separate issues,worst

15/05/2016,1,im in new york and trying to catch a cab to the airport  it is pouring down rain and the taxis are busy  i decided that i would try uber  the app kept timing out on my iphone then it came up and said uber pool  im thinking ok i will share a ride and save some money laguardia is only 75 miles away and it usually about 35 for a cab fare  it took about 15 minutes but i was willing to wait to i didnt miss my flight   i had a very nice driver and a nice car but he couldnt tell me how much  i was the only passenger so i thought ok i got lucky and no one else is going to the airport since it said uber pool  i had no other choices anyway  i have a computer training business so i am very savvy with technology  i arrived at the airport and he said it would compute the fee but he couldnt tell me how much because the app had also put in jfk and not laguardia which is not what i chose  maybe another potential customer not sure  i got the receipt and was charge 179 for the short trip  when i contacted uber they said since it was busy they could charge me 36 times the normal fair  that is really taking advantage of your customers  i dont think my customers would be happy if i told them since they scheduled their training on a very busy day that my rate would be 3 or 4 times more than normal  this is price gouging  i will never ever use uber again,worst

04/05/2016,1,the truth is that uber sucks what we need is serious improvement on the taxi system rather than replacing it with a gigantic corporation that has way waaay too much power in a unregulated market uber is too big to be controlled and that is a serious threat workers and consumers i had an important medical appointment yesterday im being treated with scheduled shots for a serious medical condition the uber driver who was supposed to pick me up cancelled the trip because of surging prices each and every time i tried to get an uber car it was the same thing the app showed the car arriving in a few minutes but you could see the car taking turns and driving around to have me cancelling the trip and allowing him to make more money on another trip due to surging rates it has happened many times in the past and the internet is full of negative reviews stating the very same problem which ive heard from friend in brazil as well,worst
02/05/2016,1,my interaction with uber support has turned out to be very unprofessional with an unfair final decision leading me to ask how can anyone count on such company to stand up for their well being and safety as a partner uber will not assist his partners in any safety incidents but rather take a step back and cut all ties whenever you as a partner find yourself in a situation that would qualify to be dangerous for your safety i got assaulted got some weird smelly liquid sprayed inside my car with no idea of what it was a bottle thrown at me my car kicked by that same rider luckily there wasnt any dents and then when i call the safety line to report the incident my account got terminated for having to physically remove that rider when she tries to jump back inside my car while i am not even in it god knows what her intentions were do the math,worst
02/05/2016,1,i use uber service very often and liked the service until the recent experience i called for uberx service for my family pick up from the airport all went well until next day new charged appeared by uber called upcharge apparently i had 5 passengers in a 4 max car service driver never notified me of this policy or garage us a warning and drove us later on uber decided to up charged due to extra passenger i believe this is illegal since i was never told of this potential extra charge consumer should be given a upfront notice prior to picking up a passenger,worst
28/04/2016,5,understand that theses people use there own cars and uber will deactivate them over any lie or lower than 45 star if we appreciate better service then show it by rating drivers well dont want it like the old days again wait 30 minutes or more for a taxi treat uber drivers right,best

27/04/2016,1,i have been using them for a while and it was great however recently i noticed that they are charging me at their own free wish and disregard my numerous concern or question to help these are some of my observation on my recent use app shows they are 1 minute away so you click on them to pick you then they wont show off until 15 to even 30 minutes in freezing cold winter snowy or rainy days,worst
27/04/2016,2,i have been in business for myself for over 30 years and started driving for uber at the behest of my wife and daughter who thought i would have fun driving for them i told them that i thought it was ridiculous to treat your personal car as a cab hauling people around with all costs of operation including risk on your own back then uber taking 25 plus riders fee as their take for virtually doing nothing except using their software a truly incredible business model thoughfor them to get rich not youever no one was ever able to explain to me if it actually made dollar sense to drive so i took a one month part time challenge driving 70 hours total on some weekdays and some weekends dont believe the liars who say they make 1500 a week or more they would have to work nonstop to even come close and even then the other costs that uber takes and the cost of maintenance insurance gas etc would make that evaporate ,worst
26/04/2016,1,i was ripped off many times overcharged by uber and when want to ask or complain they of course have a bridge to nowhere type of system where it is impossible to actually state your complain it is categorized where you can not find the right button it also seems there is no real response,worst

26/04/2016,1,i have been using uber religiously for 23 months now everyone had bad things to say about not trusting them but because i had mostly good experiencing i defended them until they started to charge you however they feel the app says if you cancel 5 mins after youve requested you get charged fair enough but i have requested and wasnt happy with my wait time and cancelled within seconds and was charged on 3 occasions this happened fortunately they credit back my account once a driver cancelled on me because he preferred a trip to downtown toronto i got charged for that they refunded it too after i disputed it,worst
26/04/2016,4,ive been using uber regularly for about a year now i have had only positive experiences so far except for one instance when a driver tried to scam me she accepted my request and a minute or so later the app status suddenly changed to on trip i thought this was very strange and assumed perhaps there was a glitch or maybe the driver had accidentally hit the wrong button so i canceled and requested again i was connected to the same driver but surely enough the app said i was on my way after a few moments again i wanted to give my driver the benefit of the doubt and i chalked it up to the fact that i havent updated uber yet however i noticed that her car was starting to move along the route toward my destination interesting i thought maybe she was trying to turn somewhere but she just kept going and it became clear that she was going to take me where i wanted to go without me in the car at all,best
26/04/2016,1,i called uber to go home usually i get charged less than 5 yesterday night after work i called an uber i noticed that the driver took a different route i even asked him and he said the gps was telling him the direction i got home and got charged 612 no problem everything was fine then today i got an email saying that the driver miscalculated the mins or whatever so i got charged additional 2040 i am so upset i feel scammed by something i trusted for 2 years please dont ride uber anymore some drivers are greedy and want money out of their passengers too bad he scammed the wrong person i am not stopping until i get my money back i already told my family and friends that uber is a scam i dont want them to experience what happened to me do not trust uber ,worst

09/04/2016,1,recently the uber rates were lowered to a rate that significantly beats the rate to the standard yellow taxis in the city nyc yet uber finds a way to always scam the customer with ridiculous markups for busy times or in demand areas etc mind you were not talking about a measly 50 cent or so surcharge they actually double the estimate rate on many occasions one day without paying attention you might end up having to pay 80 for what youve taken at a rate 40 on several occasions only because there were quite a few people requesting other drivers in that area at once seriously  _x000d_the support is a complete joke at least when i call a cc or my bank support although im getting someone from thailand or singapore someone actually picks up the phone uber doesnt even have a number this is a company valued in the billions againseriously_x000d_after you send the email for a charge dispute they are very polite in telling you no our calculations are correct at present rider rates um no theyre not if the more expensive rate setting alternative is cheaper_x000d_folks dont fall for the trend of using uber because many others are trend setters will wait on line for 3hrs to get a muffin because so and so celebrity gets their pastries there yea i knowreally stupid so dont be one of those plenty of alternative car services in this big city thatll actually pick you up with a set rate to give you before they even come _x000d_otherwise the yellow cabbies are still cheaper  no matter what bs marketing they try to pass you,worst
09/04/2016,1,i have had some terrible experiences with the uber cab drivers they are terrible with directions and they are extremely arrogant _x000d_once a driver asked me to get off the cab because he thought i gave the wrong pick up address and in another instance the driver shouted at me because i told him to take a specific route i have had many such experiences and so have my family members_x000d_if anyone faces an issue like this please take them directly to the police station i regret not doing that myself,worst
09/04/2016,1,i tried to use uber for the first time today and what a joke the android app is the most amateur and unusable app ive ever seen seriously who designed it it is completely not logical follows few if any standards completely nonintuitive i seriously wonder if you need to take drugs to understand how to use it im not even joking head meds crack cocaine  something the website is even worse the absolutely least user friendly and nonfunctional website i have ever seen from a company larger than 5 employees whats up with that then if you get through all of that which takes a roughly 2 hour learning curve because the app makes no sense until you start trying random things  it only accepts certain kinds of credit cards it wants bank cards so it can presumably drain your bank account at will but rejects secure cards that limit the damage criminal companies like uber can do thats nice,worst
06/04/2016,1,we noticed uber charges on our credit card for rides we did not take found out that we could not call uber to notify them only email after 5 days of back and forth emails with 10 different customer service people during which time fraud charges were continuing with uber and we had cancelled the amex which is strange uber finally told us that a miss mom was using our account or created their own account with our card the only fraud charges with the card were with uber they gave us zero peace of mind with their security systems with credit card information basically we got the sense that there is no security and they have no sense of urgency when it comes to fraudulent credit card use luckily we have fraud protection with amex even though uber will still try to hold us liableobviously going to lyft nowuber is horrible,worst
06/04/2016,1,i was charged a 47 times surcharge _x000d_now im trying to resolve this with uber customer service and what a joke_x000d_its like being trapped in an endless circle_x000d_i will not use them again and i will not recommend uber to anyone,worst
06/04/2016,1,uber a company valued at 61 billion dollars uber is very popular with their riders the reason uber is so loved by their riders is because a uber ride is about 13rd the price of a taxi_x000d_a uber rider can pay a minimum of 480 for a ride a taxi would charge around 1000 for the same ride a uber driver will average 10 minutes to go pick up a rider and take the rider to their destination and drop them off uber driver ends the trip and uber instantly displays how much the driver is paid 240 for the trip the trip will take around 30 minutes of your time now the driver has to pay for their gas insurance wear and tear  on their vehicle after the driver figures in the expenses he or she is left with a profit of zero_x000d_i have drove for uber part time for 2 years plus in the beginning i easily made 35000 a week now i average 7500 a week and drive twice the miles to make that uber has not sent my 2015 1099s to report the income to the irs when you email uber about a problem you will receive a robot answer uber does not care about their drivers uber only cares about increasing their 61 billion dollar value to 81 billion i am a retired man and my advice to anyone who is considering driving for uber isdont waste your time and money you will be better off flipping burgers at mcdonalds,worst
05/04/2016,1,uberpool is a total scam and as a matter of fact i think the algorithm is totally off in many cases uberpool would charge me more than a uberx for exactly the same route during the same time of a week and the only difference is pool wasted me twice the time for picking up the second passenger from the airport where we had to drive in and wait and pick up the other passenger from one of the terminals i tried contacting customer service five times because it made no sense to me at all and i doubt whether any of the customer support people had any sense how the product actually works or even how to read at all because none of them ever answered my question and instead just said very random and useless things to me dear uber please at least spend some money training your people because they made your company look very stupid and unprofessional and to nyc passengers take the yellow cab because they are at least registered officially and the pricing is transparent,worst
04/04/2016,1,i was with family coming back home after shopping we called uber the first time ever the driver probably was drunk he took totally a wrong route and when we said its wrong he said he has to follow the directions which were shown on his uber device he just kept driving and suddenly we found our selves on highway i got worried and ask him to call some one he said he cant do that he was driving so rough and just kept going on the highway we asked him to just stop and let us go but he said he cant coz he wont get paid then at last we have to tell him that if he doesnt stop we will call 911 he just suddenly applied the breaks and we escaped the accident by mere inches finally he let us got off whrn we said we will pay him in cash and we realized we were in some different city we took a taxi and came home uber charged us the extra fare and the trip cost us 130  what would have been just 1215 the worst and scariest experience of my life so please just be careful as anyone can register with uber so you never know who you gonna trust,worst
04/04/2016,2,i was a driver for uber i kept a record of my trip history from which included the time i received the call for pickup the time of pickup the time of dropoff and what the mileage was when i picked up and dropped off the rider when i reviewed my trip history with what uber paying me for i discovered that there was substantial difference in mileage that from my car and uber is showing some trips were short over 3 miles uber refused to pay me for all the discrepancies i showed them one trip they charged the customer for but didnt pay me anything thank god i kept a detailed record off what i did i was cheated out of 38 miles of travel i could go on but i am using a librarytimed computer,worst

28/03/2016,1,the second email said if you do not use it you will lose it so we decided to use it from hollywood beach fl to miami beach fl this past saturday afternoon then our card was charged and it did not have the discount removed from bill i wrote them since there is no telephone to call i sent many emails with copies of the promotional email they sent twice every response was from different person and each response said that the promotion was already used in nov 2015 for my account i wrote how can that be when the two emails from your company were dated feb 18 2016 and march 21 2016 no response except to repeat that we do not get the 20 off this charge,worst
27/03/2016,1,you cant pay cash on uber so you cant control how much they put on your card  a driverthat uber seems to support is to not show your trip as ended  so the driver picked up my girlfriend and dropped her at my house both addresses were input in the app but she got no receipt that day as the trip according to uber wasnt ended until over 20 hours and 50 miles  i assume the driver defrauded us or there was a glitch in their software but after days of correspondence and sending a copy of the receipt i still get the runaround  i fought for uber to be allowed here in miami as the cabs were horrible  now the cabs are better and i can avoid being scammed using uber,worst
26/03/2016,1,the driver drove me a distance of what would have been a 10 cab ride and charged 3500 and thats not the worst part  he tried to charge my credit card 185000 and 120000 luckily discover card caught it flagged it and denied it  the charge was attempted through a company called lavish limos,worst

23/03/2016,3,uber cab service is pathetic in india  youll feel cheated everytime you travel with them they will charge cancellation fee of rs 80 everytime the booking is cancelled by the cab driver due to his own reasons their so called promo codes never work and after paying the driver you have to lodge a written complain through your mail id or uber app to resolve the issues and this normally takes between 2472 hours to get resolved uber will refund the money and credit it in your uber account so to use that you again have to book a cab this is how uber forcefully tries to retain their customers_x000d_the drivers are unprofessional customer support too is very poor in india their app is not up to the mark and multiple issues arise during payment,average
22/03/2016,1,uber is not good for the country because they are taking off the marker  traditional taxis which we need in the london we are better off without uber and use our black taxis like we use,worst

19/03/2016,1,uber seemed to be ideal since i just moved back home to columbus and im a single full time parent  ubers app sent me to fictitious addresses wrong addresses and  refused to accept responsibility for the wasted time fuel and deficiencies of their own app  _x000d_the passengers constantly complained to me about the apps functionality and the inability of contacting uber customer support_x000d_the cost of driving for uber is too high  car payment fuel oil changes uber fee and passenger fee leaves minimum wages for the driver  while uber claims that drivers can make great money its actually uber that is making great money_x000d_charging drivers high fees on top of maintenance costs of their own vehicles is ridiculous,worst
19/03/2016,2,my experiences are mixed with a couple of good rides but on the whole were negative actual experiences bad  surge pricing has no upper limit a trip which normally costs about 20 ended up costing almost 150 due to ubers uncapped surge pricing policy uber has no city or government limit on prices meaning that they can pretty much gouge what they want as opposed to taxis who have rates limited by law often the surge pricing does not reflect the reality of what the demand and cost actually are out in the streets extending beyond the actual surge in demand in order to add a little extra,worst
18/03/2016,1,i used uber from sky harbor airport first a uberx got wrong address and called from nowhere after 10 minutes and asked me cancel trip since she went to wrong address and far away from me uber charged me 5 dollars for cancellation and unexpected second time uber directed me to select uberselect and got the driver he was late before i took his car i asked the price and he said he is uber select and it cost 60 usd to my home i go to sky harbor very frequently and it is exactly 30 miles from my home he took the longest route and charged 95 usd for 38 miles will never take uberselect or black or suv they have a base charge chargemile and then the charge for time a complete rip off,worst

21/02/2016,1,if you are contemplating driving for uber in nj think againmaybe 3x ask around all i know from my experience as a driver for three months with 500 trips under my belt and a 48 ratingbe very very circumspect before leasing a car what they do is rope you in as a driver with decent pay for two weeksthen whamthey cut the fares in half let me ask you as a logical human beingcan a driver who has usually a car payment of at least 600 per monthplus insuranceunless the ins co finds out you drive for uber and then prestodrops you like a rusty safe in the river plus gas and wear and tear on the car driver 1015 minutes for 3well that is the fare they pay also if you happen to drive to manhattanand they take out 20 for toll and charge the customerand then only pay you 815 on top of that to drop off the customer before you have to drive through traffic to get back into nj to accept another fare which usually takes at least an hourdo you think that is a good usage of time and good pay you see what uber is doing is trying to show wall street watch the big short very appropo for uber the huge rider base the problem is that the drivers are dropping out like flies because they can not afford to drive i know as i have picked up many ex drivers recounting the same experience wall stwhich incidentally i used to work for years ago for almost two decadesis about to have a rude awakening when they see the market valuation uber claims of 63 bill even though they lost over 467 mill in 2015from a confidential source yours truly picked up devulgedis nothing more than specious and a house of cards now ubers pr will tell you how wonderful it is to slash fares all in order to be more busy for the drivers but dont believe a word they say it is because they are burning through drivers faster than the indie speedway all in order to keep riders happy good luck people in your decision but know that you had better do your homework before you get involved in such an exploitive outfit be damn careful,worst

25/01/2016,1,while i understand all of the cabhating the one point i worry about is insurance with uber et al this article talks about major injuries people experienced do these new startups have the same level of insurance coverage as traditional cabs are required to have what will happen when the news starts reporting catastrophic injuries passengers receive in an uber subscribed vehicle but having to be on medicaid because there was no insurance in place,worst
24/01/2016,1,more than once ive had to witness uber drivers not following the laws of the road for instance  one driver was driving on top of bicycle lanes and areas not meant for moving cars another time another driver was on a side street at a stop sign but made an inappropriate gesture with his hand and halted traffic moving along a busy road so that he could cross over despite not having the right of way  its not just infuriating it is beyond unsafe to have these untrained unregulated unruly drivers be allowed to engage in such a profession and endanger the lives of others they might have provided faster service and maybe this is what they think will give them better ratings and reviews but i would rather be alive and it is beyond shameful that uber does nothing to discourage and prevent this sort of recklessness,worst

05/12/2015,1,ive been driving for uber in the midwest for eight months my average hourly income after gas is about 7hr on short trips uber takes about 50 percent of the fare  in my city that means i pocket 235 a ride  the fifty percent comes from 180 safe ride charge and then 20 of what remains you can expect 23 trips an hour longer trips are more profitable percentage wise but not much  during surge pricing 3x and up you can do ok but surge times are limited and you can only expect a few surge rides a night  last night was very average for me  six hours 100 miles 40  two surge rides but only 18x  im sure some of the larger markets are better longer average trips more surge etc but not really worth the time in a city smaller than dallas houston etc  the uber concept is great for riders drivers and mostly uber  i really enjoy driving for them  i put this out there so any prospective driver knows what to expect  im sure over time as uber finds it harder and harder to find drivers that the compensation schedule will change  until then ill just uber around for beer money and call it good,worst

30/11/2015,4,i drive for uber in milwaukee wisconsin i keep my car clean inside and out and often receive compliments on cleanliness uber drivers cannot be called from a time of more than 15 minutes from the pick up point unless there is no other driver in the area i have been called at 16 minutes without surge pricing speaking about pricing in the milwaukee area the minimum charge is currently 525 uber x of which the driver receives 320 the rate is based on 120mile and 020 minute uber x passengers often call uber x when they should be calling an xl but are rarely turned away this does not give them a right to complain on that part customers are given estimates of the cost as long as they put in the destination and are notified if it is surging they are allowed to cancel at any time even after i arrive without penalty fares can vary based on route taken construction delays accidents and other traffic delays i  end the trip immediately as per uber policy when i mess up on the route get stuck in traffic or if the customer gets upset because of the trip the customer is my number one priority and i treat every passenger the way i would want them to treat me the large part of my ridership is intoxicated college students and they often get rowdy in my car it takes alot of patience which gets trying to keep professional if this doesnt sound like a job for you please dont apply to drive i agree that there are problems with uber most freqently is due to gps location with dropped pins i suggest to manually enter your location of pick up and drop off and contact your driver as soon as you get a conformation and verify your location i notify all my passengers when i arrive of the address i am at to confirm my location is where they want me for passengers if you are expecting an uber to arrive please be ready look for a message and respond promptly drivers are paid per completed trip not per hour and do not make money sitting and waiting which is why i only wait 5 minutes after i arrive unless the customer contacts me responds to my message or asks me to wait i often get into a surging area for pick up and have to wait for a customer who never shows or cancels after i have been waiting this is upsetting because i could be out picking up an actual person who needs my service drivers do not know where your destination is until he starts the trip so we cannot decline to take you anywhere until we have already started the trip after which we are committed to following through because the app does not allow us to cancel a trip in progress i have never turned away a customer based on destination nor for them needing my trunk space i have picked up customers from grocery stores and helped them with their groceries even carried them inside for them i have picked up people for the airport and loaded and unloaded their luggage and wished them a safe trip in milwaukee uber does not have privileges to pick up at mitchell international airport or at least uber xs i often make trips from the downtown area to waukesha new berlin greenfield grafton oak creek and pewaukee these fares are typically between 13 to 26 on nonsurge rates those trips are between 15 and 25 minutes one way my take on these trips average out to about a dollar per mile and uber takes the rest,best
30/11/2015,5,well ive been reading the uber reviews on here and they are hilarious i just started driving for uber this week so far 5 trips 9033 for uber 6650 for me i dont think thats too bad could be better yes but not bad as a driver you can deduct all uber mileage at the federal rate of 575 as of this review which will change your tax liability this is a good thing you will get to keep most of your money earned i think the app works fine would like to know where passenger is going before i take fare but thats ok i like the fact that i can drive when i want i think most of these reviews are from taxi companies trying to take them out of business no one ever is going to charge 300 for a 12 mile cab ride you all are idiots uber is a great idea that i wish i would have thought of uber requires your car to be 2005 or newer im sure theres a few uber drivers that suck but that is to be expected give bad reviews and they will be suspended cab companies beware i think your time has come,best

27/09/2015,5,just started using uber during a trip to seattle this summer  during that trip had a chance to use uber about a dozen different times  then a half dozen trips in portland oregon  just got back from a trip to new york where i used uber extensively as well as a few rides on a yellow cab  in every case uber was extremely convenient  the vehicles were always on the new side clean and comfortable  the drivers were prompt helpful provided us with walking directions information on places to check out and warnings about areas that were sketchy etc  because your ride is paid for automatically via the app there is never any fumbling with cash credit card reader systems etc  just get to your destination and go_x000d_the iphone app is a breeze to set up and use  it allows you to chose the type and size of vehicle you need lets you know how long you will have to wait for your ride and gives realtime location updates on the uber you have requested  it also gives you the name and customer ratings of your driver before you book the ride notifies you as soon as your uber arrives to pick you up and allows you to contact your driver via cell if there are any issues  you are always asked to rate your last driver before you can book a new ride which assures that uber has extensive customer feedback but can slow things down a bit if you are trying to book your next ride in a hurry_x000d_our experience using yellow cabs in many cities has not been great  by and large have always experienced long wait times when booking a cab by phone  the standard seems to be your cab will be there in 15 to 45 minutes  usually this works out to be 30 minutes plus  have also had issues with cabbies not wanting to do business with me when my ride is only a couple of miles or less  in one case had a cabbie whose car wouldnt start until after we had gotten out of his car and jumped into another cab  the cabs always seem to be vintage  at least five years old   poorly maintained and on the gritty side  our last experience with a cab ride was from la guardia to new yorks financial district  it was like the long beach grand prix meets destruction derby  lots of jackrabbit starts swerving in and out of traffic at high speed slamming on brakes  all in a car that hadnt seen new shock absorbers in about a decade  my wife and  i were both motion sick but were too freaked out by our fast and furious driver to try fixing our eyes on the horizon_x000d_allinall i am sold on uber  highly recommend it and personally will never use a cab again unless i am forced to,best

13/09/2015,2,as a driver the most frustrating element is that the app does not work well  more often than not it does not recognize that i have arrived at the pickup point and can begin the trip  so rather than make the rider wait i will begin the trip  but this means that the navigation system wont initiate to give directions  and just as frequently the app doesnt recognize that you have arrived at the destination so you can end the trip  ubers answer is to employ a small army of workers to make adjustments to the ride beginningending and the associated fare after the fact  when i first started with uber only two months ago the app worked well 80 of the time  now the above noted glitches occur 90 of the time  uber likes to send annoying reminder messages to the drivers  time and energy would be better spent fixing the navigation app  uber is losing drivers due to the hassles,worst

01/03/2015,1,we used uber for the first time last night  thankfully we had a 3000 first time rider credit that covered our trip to american airlines center we had an awesome trip to the mavericks game and we loved our driver and the rate was reasonable however when the game was over and we went to the app to get a ride home they had a surge fee and they were now charging 5 times the normal rate we waited thinking the surge rate would go down after the game had been over for a while and even signed up to be notified when the surge was over two hours after the game we had a nice bartender at pira lounge help us get a ride we had to pay 6000 for a 20 min ride home with in style limo service but uber would have been over 10000 plus tip ridiculous so people beware that they suck you in with a very reasonable fee then upcharge you with a surge fee that can happen at any time and leave you stuck or paying way too much we never received notice when the surge was over either i will never use them again our poor dogs were 2 12 hours past due going out  i was livid being stranded with no reasonable way home,worst

07/12/2014,1,i have been a loyal uber user since they first launched in nyc area i had no serious complaints until recently like many other users on this site i was charge over 250 on halloween for surge rates which in my opinion are a complete scam the notification about the rate surge was not clear in october and the management team did nothing to help besides credit 30 total bs i used uber again last evening during the rain and a total of 8 miles was 225 how is it even legal to charge that amount for an 8 mile trip not only was the trip 8 miles but the driver went in the opposite direction to avoid some congestion which resulted in double the mileage the car was described to be a mercedes benz r class and when it arrive it was a black town car if it says mercedes a mercedes should arrive also i will be using yellow cabs from now on the is no regulation with uber it seems they can just charge whatever fare they please and then send you an exhorbitant receipt i now see why the far isnt disclosed as you are driving with uber driver bc most times there would be an argument on the spot if it was so many unfair business practices i will be filing complaints wherever i can possibly file them there must be more consumer protection and awareness for these type of scams not to mention the uber x drivers are not insured as they should be driving with personal plates and no commercial insurance coverage shame on you uber,worst

17/11/2014,1,firstly there is the service  one day you might get a ride with someone who speaks the same language as you and is driving a clean vehicle that isnt dented rusting or doesnt stink like the 9th circle of hell inside but that will be a rare day if you ever do  secondly if you find yourself outside of their preferred pick up areas you are not going to get a ride or you will wait longer than you wold have for a taxi or legal rideshare  third there is no insurance  uber is falsely advertising that they actually have insurance their tos page invalidates any and all coverage for you once you get in the vehicle  fourth their surge pricing scam is obviously not about a lack of supply or demand or they wouldnt be dropping the surge price once a few of their drivers have picked up people at three times the normal rate in the same area  it is a method of keeping their vehicles in one area so uber can collect more fees from their drivers  it has nothing to do with customer service or actual demand and it destroys the green factor of the service as it puts twice as many vehicles on the road than would be needed  this isnt even a real rideshare company it is just a crappy point to point service   if you do not care about your own safety or the safety of those you travel with or the planet this is the service for you,worst

22/10/2014,1,this is a follow up to my previous review in dallas uber has further increased their cut of the total take while reducing the cost of a ride now uber charges 80 cents per ride a dollar and 70 cents for their fee per ride which they take off the top and 20 percent of what is left thus a minimum ride a ride under 4 miles will attract an uber charge of 5 the driver gets a gross of 2 dollars and 60 cents while uber takes 2 dollars and 40 cents if you are unlucky enough to give a ride to an smu student the would order you to take them to a fast food place usually a mile or one and a half away they make you go through the drive through if it is whatasaburger be sure you will spend anywhere between five to ten minutes waiting in line with your car running afterwards they eat in the car spill drinks food leave trash and jump out of your car after you drive them back with out tipping guess how much is your gross it is a wopping 2 dollars and 60 cents i used to get so worked up about it and i am not usually able to hide my feeling about it such that i usually get a 1 star rating from those students somebody would say if you hate it so much why not quit i will tell you why i joined uber 2 years ago at that time my second wife had just died of multiple sclerosis i still had two teenagers and an 11 year old at home i had to find something that would be flexible at that time uber was advertising 35 dollars an hour for uber x if you really do the math you will realise that even if it was true it is not much because the amount was merely gross and the hourly mentioned was driving hours after you have picked up a client it does not include the time spent in your car running the engine and waiting for uber call neither does it include distances driven to pick up passengers if the client cancells after you get there then it does not count so i decided that uber black was the way to go you make fewer rides and much more money so i contacted uber asked about car requirements with their approval i took 48 000 dollar loan to buy a car when i tried to register it as uber black i could not i sent an email and h ot a reply encouraging me to register it as uber x and then open another email and register it as uber black i tried to do that but it was all a lie a year later somebody at uber finally told me that they stopped registering uber black in the same month that i was asking them if it was okay to buy my car to use as uber black to cut the long story short i had to run the car as uber black later uber came up with uber select and they let me register and for a while it was better uber sellect cost about twice the cost of uber x i switched to only uber select pretty soon uber ordered all uber select to also do x or be turned off then t hey systematically began to kill off uber select business by always surging the price of uber select the alternative is to flip burgers but it will not pay for my 900 dollar a month car loan so i am forced to spend a gazillion hours at least twelve to be able to earn anything between 100 and 200 dollars gross per day thete that is why am still doing it until i find an alternative what irks me most is the fact that everbody blames the drivers the press make uber drivers the villain they do not know the city they are not curteous they are dishonest etc but who advocates for them who sincerely wonders how they make ends meet what about the american tradition of tips why should it not apply to uber drivers some will say why do they do it if it is so bad i have told you my reason but now let us look at it broadly maslows hierarchy of needs it suggests that a human has 5 needs that must be satisfied in a hierarchical order begining from the lowest to the highest in order to satisfy these needs humans do what they must however when one lower need is satisfied the next in hierarchy becomes a need a very hungry man will even for to work for food that does not mean that he is willing to work gor food only as soon as he is full he will want other things like clothes shoes housing etc a person pressed to a corner would work for uber no matter how low his take uber knows that that is why there was a time they would pay up to 800 dollars to get you convince friend or family to work for uber now they pay 300 dollars so when you get some one not knowing the city do not just give him a bad rating be gracious it is only a gracious person that will give dignity and not take it away that poor guy is trying his best to follow his american dream not knowing that heshe is a mere hapless pawn in the hands of the great shark called uber who pleases and woes her customers by using her drivers as mere fodder i have much more to say but am afraid this is becoming too long however i cannot resist wondering what holds us together as a nation our military are known for leaving no one behind why would we close our eyes to the plight of fellow americans not long ago apple was being taken to task for making their phones in china and paying very low wages why do we let uber mistreat so many our country men and we keep quiet it is cheap yes but would you sell your family for cheap stuff are we truely a nation or have we gone back to the land of france before revolution are we gone back to creating bourgeoisie and the peasants classes all in the name of cheapness and convenience thanks for reading_x000d_okonkwo,worst
16/10/2014,4,overall i have enjoyed uber as a passenger  unfortunately though i recently had a bad experience with a driver and the customer service was worse  im a loyal customer having taken 28 trips for 900 in just 30 days and was quite offended at how they handled this  overall i love uber but i am sincerely disappointed about how they handled my complaint_x000d_on october 14 2014 i requested uber at 7 am  the driver flew past my house and i tried to call them twice to ask them to turn around and come back as they just parked at the end of the block  the driver didnt answer so i walked a block and a half to get my uber_x000d_when i got into the car i was overpowered by the scent of bo andor some other offensive odor  i dont think the driver had it but the car was full of the smell  ugh i walked a block and a half for this pleasure    _x000d_we then started our trip  by the time we hit the steelyard curve on 176 she was chatting away at me not bad in and of itself except    and looking at me while she spoke  i looked ahead at the line of brake lights ahead of us and shrieked  we came within inches of rearending the car ahead of us  yikes_x000d_after that she drove 50 mph on the highway for the duration of our smelly trip_x000d_i contacted uber that afternoon and the first guy said sorry about your experience and that was it   _x000d_the second person said well talk to grace and ill look into it but i heard nothing further_x000d_the third person said  and this is a direct quote from her email sorry to hear that well be sure to follow up with grace to check in and share this concern again thank you for taking the time to write in ive added 10 credit to your account for the trouble while it doesnt make up for the experience we hope this will allow you to have a better one in the future_x000d_yeah amber  youre right it doesnt make up for the experience  bad enough you dont even have a loyaltyfrequent rider program but after your credit i still paid 25 for that ride_x000d_they dont have a phone number either so you cant call anyone to complain  youre at the mercy of email,best
12/10/2014,2,uber website needs improvements  fare quote doesnt work and doesnt tell you what it will take to work eg what type of info  i simply chose new orleans and then said airport or msy airport and westin hotel canal street   it should be able to figure that out   when you clear results to try again you cant edit the start location  you have to reload the page which takes you back to choosing a city   found it completely in effective_x000d_another flaky thing is that i log in and it shows my account then i go to get a fare quote and it takes be back to search city and implies that i need to log in again    hope they can fix these few simple things   using ie 11096,worst

30/09/2014,1,i was an uber driver in raleighnc for 2 months a couple months after the launch just to check out what all the hype was about first and foremost driving for uber is like working for about 10hrmaybe when you do the math uber charges riders in raleigh 120 per mile they pay their drivers 80percent of that or 96mile that is a mathmatical factas a driverwhen you pickup a passenger and drive them to their destination you have to drive back to the hot pickup area to get another farethats a fact raleigh is not new york city where you can pick up a riderdrive them across the city and pick up another fare 5 blocks away in raleigh you pickup a rider drive them 10 miles awayand then drive back the same 10 miles to get another faretypically in downtown or local concerts etc i did it and i know i even camped out at the airport for 2 weeks from 7am10am when 35 flights typically come in from big uber markets very few calls to drive and i positioned myself so that i would be the first to be called because of an area i know about very close to the terminals back to the nasty math that uber hates to talk aboutyour 96mile is now half that or 48milebecause you have to drive back to pickup another passenger gas in an efficient car is 15per mile that you drive bro now you are down to making 33mile hardly what i call a good job parttime or otherwise considering you are wearing out your car driving people around no bs what i have just told you herejust the facts1162015 update uber has now dropped their rider fees to 75mile in raleigh amazing take everything i stated above regarding the money you can make at uber as a driver and reduce it by over half now they have added a bogus hourly guaranteewith conditions that are not within your ability to controland have the gall to state that they are looking out for the drivers most drivers are actually losing money driving for uber nowwhen they factor in gas and car expensesnevermind making any moneypeopleyou need to have your heads examined if you continue driving for uber regards,worst

13/05/2013,1,uber has several problems that make it a poor experience for consumers imho based on my own experiences1 their drivers are not welltrained or carefully selected as a result some drivers dont know where they are going and are just bad drivers who would never be hired by a taxi company which in my book is pretty bad so your trip could take twice as long as it should which means if youre late its very hard to depend on uber 2  it costs a lot some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab they also use surge pricing which can increase the price of your fare 3 uber customer service has a bad attitude sort of like youre wrong this is why were right im not saying their customer service is worse than cab companies but i am saying my experience with uber customer service was poor so in summation uber is a good idea poorly executed id try one of the other cab hailing apps in your city flywheel instacab etc because youre likely to save money and have a better driver,worst
08/05/2013,5,uber is kind of like magic you punch a few buttons on the app on your phone and you watch as a black car appears out of nowhere at your doorstep its so much better than calling a taxi its ridiculous it does come at a price thoughthe black car service ive found to be about 2025 more than a taxi and the uber taxi service was maybe 1015 more but honestly its kind of worth it its so painlessif only every service was like this,best
